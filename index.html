<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The technological landscape globally is evolving at never before seen rates; and as such, it is imperative for one to acquire the requisite skills to keep up with the global trends and changes in technology. I am from Uganda, a small country in Africa which is considerably a few steps behind in terms of technological advancement and uptake.</p>
<p>It is against this background that I took an interest in Web Development and signed up for an online course to equip me with the necessary skills to navigate software development. I am well versed with a number of programming languages by now; the very basic and foundational ones at least. With these skills and knowledge that I hope to build on, polish and make better, I am up for new challenges that will put my training to test there by giving me an opportunity to learn and perform good work. </p>
<p>I also have the zeal, ardour and enthusiasm to do my best and as such you can expect total and undivided devotion to your project.</p>
